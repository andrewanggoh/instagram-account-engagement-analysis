## Project Background

AO Snack, a healthy snack brand, uses Instagram to build brand awareness and engage with its audience. I'm taking a role as a data analyst to extract insights and provide recommendations to the social media and marketing teams to drive higher engagement on the Instagram account.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this analysis are to:
  - ✅ To understand ... and ...
  - ❌ Evaluate Rainbow Retail's sales performance from 2018 to 2022
  - ❌ Identify key trends and patterns in sales data -> (*too generic! explain the why and specify what metrics of sales*)
  - ❌ Provide actionable recommendations for business optimization and growth -> (*recommendation to who? and for what purpose? specify that!*)

Note:

1. More about why, rather than showing what you will do.
2. Specify the metrics, the recommendation to whom, and what purpose.
3. In other words, don't use terminology that everyone in data analytics can say. It doesn't make you stand out.
4. Better to have depth rather than breadth. Insights is detailed. Don't take too much. For example, just take 2 of goal suggestion below and not all of them.

Goal suggestion:

1. Customer Segmentation and Profiling: customer characteristics
2. Product Performance Analysis: product performances in terms of sales, returns, etc.
3. Return Analysis: pattern and causes of product returns to identify areas for improvement.
4. Growth Insights: uncover trends and opportunities for business growth.


## Data Structure Overview

[Description (Example)]

</p>

The analysis used synthetic data representing customers, sales, product categories, and transaction dates from January 2018 to December 2022. Key data points include:

- ✅ **Product Data**: Reference table that includes product ID, product name, and sub-category.
- ❌ **Product Data**: Specifications and revenue contributions by category.

- ✅ **Sales Data**: Each unique record represents a sales transaction with information about the sales dates, sales quantity, and product.
- ❌ **Sales Data**: Monthly sales and revenues trends.

Note:

1. Put a snapshot of the data that we're working with! You can use [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/home).
2. Take a perspective as a data analyst who is telling another data analyst.
3. **Be specific!** : specially in phrases.

   - ❌ Data cleaning and transformation were conducted using ... for enhanced analytical flexibility.
     - What is the meaning of "*enhanced analytical flexibility*"? It doesn't tell anything about your skill.
   - ✅ Just tell what you are doing for each technical tool, or put it in the technical section at the bottom.


## Executive Summary

[Description]

Data Lingo: "Dominate", "Underperform".

Note:

1. Take the perspective of a Data Analyst who delivers 30-second overview of the most important metrics & the most important stats to someone who is at a quite high level.
2. Specify which month or time the trend is increasing or else. Don't just saya "upward trend in monthy"!
3. Use the actual value.
4. Some people didn't care about all four years squished.


## Insight Deep-Dive

### Post with Highest Engagement

</p>

**Insights**:

- 9 out of 10 top-performing posts are videos, with only 1 being a static photo.
- All 10 high-engagement posts involved collaborations – either with influencers or complementary brands aligned with the brand image (e.g., sporty influencers, hampers brand, or sports events where our product adds value).

Note:

1. Take a perspective interested in numbers, which provides more detail.
2. Get unique, tangible, and specific insights. Show that you are actually looking in to the data.
3. Broke up the topics into sections.
4. Make sure the graph and image are readable.
5. "We never use a pie chart" which we cannot see over time -> instead use an area graph!
6. Nobody's gonna make the decisions of all four years combined.
7. Every analysis trend should really be looking at something over time.

   - ✅ Take the top 5 products & group all other products, show as line month over graph -> specific insights
   - ❌ Just showing the top 10 products by sales

8. Tip: Try to tie your specific and detailed insights into a story so it can be more cohesive.

## Recommendations

Note:

1. Every recommendation should be tied to an insight that we had. Link what you found to what you recommend.

   - ✅ Given the upward trend in electric letter openers and ... in the technology category. Consider reallocating the marketing budget for the next two years to focus on these products.
   - ❌ Expand Technology offerings: Leverage strong demand for technology products to maintain market leadership.
2. Tip: We can put a simple recommendation first, then put the detailed recommendations after it.
3. Our job is to communicate exactly what we discovered and what someone should do about it. So be specific!
  
## Technical Details

Note:

1. Contain tools that we used and what they are for.
2. Put the link to your work. Example: You can explore the dashboard [here](link)

## Caveats and Assumptions

Note:

1. Contain a note about the data cleaning process that you did including any assumptions you had to make about the data.
