## Project Background

AO Snack (*pseudonym*), a healthy snack brand, uses Instagram to build brand awareness and engage with its audience. I'm taking a role as a data analyst to extract insights and provide recommendations to the social media and marketing teams to drive higher engagement on the Instagram account.

## Objective

The main objective of this analysis is:

- **Content Engagement Analysis**: To identify and understand post characteristics, including topics, post types, and influencer involvement, that drive high audience engagement.

## Dataset Overview

The analysis is based on public Instagram content data from the AO Snack account, representing posts from December 2021 to March 2025 with details including post ID, timestamp, post owner, post type, and other attributes as shown in the image below.

## Executive Summary

## Insight Deep-Dive

### Top Posts by Engagement

- **9 out of 10** top-performing posts are **videos**, with only 1 being a static photo.
- All **10 high-engagement posts involved collaborations** – either with influencers or complementary brands aligned with the brand image (e.g., sporty influencers, hampers brand, or sports events where our product adds value).

## Recommendations

Note:

1. Every recommendation should be tied to an insight that we had. Link what you found to what you recommend.

   - ✅ Given the upward trend in electric letter openers and ... in the technology category. Consider reallocating the marketing budget for the next two years to focus on these products.
   - ❌ Expand Technology offerings: Leverage strong demand for technology products to maintain market leadership.
2. Tip: We can put a simple recommendation first, then put the detailed recommendations after it.
3. Our job is to communicate exactly what we discovered and what someone should do about it. So be specific!
