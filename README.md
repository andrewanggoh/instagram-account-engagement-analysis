## Project Background

AO Snack (*pseudonym*), a healthy snack brand, uses Instagram to build brand awareness and engage with its audience. I'm taking a role as a data analyst to extract insights and provide recommendations to the social media and marketing teams to drive higher engagement on the Instagram account.

## Objective

The main objective of this analysis is:

- **Content Engagement Analysis**: To identify and understand post characteristics, including topics, post types, and influencer involvement, that drive high audience engagement.

## Dataset Overview

The analysis is based on public Instagram content data from the AO Snack account, representing posts from December 2021 to March 2025 with details including post ID, timestamp, post owner, post type, and other attributes as shown in the image below.

## Executive Summary

[Description]

Data Lingo: "Dominate", "Underperform".

Note:

1. Take the perspective of a Data Analyst who delivers 30-second overview of the most important metrics & the most important stats to someone who is at a quite high level.
2. Specify which month or time the trend is increasing or else. Don't just saya "upward trend in monthy"!
3. Use the actual value.
4. Some people didn't care about all four years squished.


## Insight Deep-Dive

### Post with Highest Engagement

**Insights**:

- 9 out of 10 top-performing posts are videos, with only 1 being a static photo.
- All 10 high-engagement posts involved collaborations – either with influencers or complementary brands aligned with the brand image (e.g., sporty influencers, hampers brand, or sports events where our product adds value).

Note:

1. Take a perspective interested in numbers, which provides more detail.
2. Get unique, tangible, and specific insights. Show that you are actually looking in to the data.
3. Broke up the topics into sections.
4. Make sure the graph and image are readable.
5. "We never use a pie chart" which we cannot see over time -> instead use an area graph!
6. Nobody's gonna make the decisions of all four years combined.
7. Every analysis trend should really be looking at something over time.

   - ✅ Take the top 5 products & group all other products, show as line month over graph -> specific insights
   - ❌ Just showing the top 10 products by sales

8. Tip: Try to tie your specific and detailed insights into a story so it can be more cohesive.

## Recommendations

Note:

1. Every recommendation should be tied to an insight that we had. Link what you found to what you recommend.

   - ✅ Given the upward trend in electric letter openers and ... in the technology category. Consider reallocating the marketing budget for the next two years to focus on these products.
   - ❌ Expand Technology offerings: Leverage strong demand for technology products to maintain market leadership.
2. Tip: We can put a simple recommendation first, then put the detailed recommendations after it.
3. Our job is to communicate exactly what we discovered and what someone should do about it. So be specific!
  
## Technical Details

Note:

1. Contain tools that we used and what they are for.
2. Put the link to your work. Example: You can explore the dashboard [here](link)

## Caveats and Assumptions

Note:

1. Contain a note about the data cleaning process that you did including any assumptions you had to make about the data.
